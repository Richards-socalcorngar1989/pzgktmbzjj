Okay, so I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Alto Knights, and dude, I’m not even sure where my head's at right now. 🤯 Can we talk about those crazy plot twists? Like one minute we're soaring high, and the next, boom! Everything's spiraling. Seriously, I haven’t been this shocked since that one gnarly turbulence over the Atlantic last month.

Anyway, the ending—wow. It felt like they were just throwing stuff at the screen to see what sticks. But I’m not gonna lie, I kinda loved it? In a chaotic, WTF kinda way, you know? It's like, how can you not enjoy a trainwreck that’s also a masterpiece of randomness? Like, am I supposed to cry or laugh? Maybe both. 😂

> And the characters, man. They were all over the place. That one dude who thought he was a hero turned villain turned... I don’t even know what to call him by the end. I mean, can someone please explain his logic? He was like a passenger who keeps hitting the call button just to ask for water over and over.

Oh! And I totally forgot I didn't even 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  —just 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮ed it. Maybe that's why I missed some details? Nah, who am I kidding, they didn’t make sense to begin with. But you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and see for yourself.

I just keep thinking, if someone wrote that script in the jumpseat during a long flight, I would totally believe it. Like, boredom can breed the craziest ideas. But seriously, there were some hidden gems of wisdom mixed in with all the madness. Like when the main guy says something deep and you think he's onto something, and then he just ruins it with a fart joke or something.

void randomFunction() { int nonsense = 42; }

Ugh, maybe I'm just overthinking it all. Or maybe not thinking at all, like when I try to answer passenger questions after a red-eye. 😂 Anyway, how you been? Catch me up on your drama, cuz I could use a real story after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 that rollercoaster.
